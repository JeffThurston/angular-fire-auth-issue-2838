# TestAngularfireAuth

This branch shows the code that reproduces the error reported
in [Issue 2838](https://github.com/angular/angularfire/issues/2838#) in the AngularFire repository on GitHub.

NOTE: In order to run this code, you will need to update `environment.ts`
and `.firebaserc` with your own firebase configuration details.
